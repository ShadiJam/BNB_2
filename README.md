https://jambandb.now.sh will allow the user to create an account, add B&B's and should allow you to leave messages on each B&B's message board. 

The information is fed to a Postgres database that stores B&B's, Messages (in theory), Visitors, as well as user/login/registration data. 

Heroku was used to create the database and the server was deployed through NOW.sh and an alias was created to the current url. 

The program is written through C# using Razor Views.
